# snake-water-gun-game
## Module used:
* random <be />
For this game, I simply used random module for one random input and another input is going to choose by user.<br />
## How game works:
If user choosed snake and computer choosed water, then user will get win and one point added for user. 
Otherwise computer will get win, one point added for computer. <br />
If user choosed water and computer choosed gun, then user will get win and one point added for user. 
Otherwise computer will get win, one point added for computer. <br />
If user choosed gun and computer choosed snake, then user will get win and one point added for user. 
Otherwise computer will get win, one point added for computer. <br />
At the end by comparing their points, program will decide who is the winner.
